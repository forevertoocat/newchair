Website deleted.<br>Im sick of this, i can't upload world files on a website that doesnt let Semisol know you are downloading the backup i guess...<br>Don't say this is false statement.<br>Semisol's download page has a verification page that makes you login into the server and get a code with a command, lets you know you downloaded the backup<br>This is why i did the website, Semisol did not like it...<br>Whatever, i got timeout from the Discord server being accused of keeping talking about the drama<br>...Just saying... Semisol started it and no i did not keep talking about it that much...<br>Anyways<br><br><br>I decided to leave CoR, i know that sucks but man this is hurting my head, too toxic...<br>MAYBE i'll come back but not for a month at least.<br>And also<br><br>fuck you semisol
